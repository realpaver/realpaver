## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-15

* Add an API to improve the reporting of solutions and handle aliases ([issue #21](https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/realpavergroup/realpaver/-/issues/21))
* Remove of useless files (README,NEWS,TODO)
* Change default value for assertion option to false
* Update of README.md to add a link to documentation

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-04

First release, with following features:

* CSP problem definition in C++ or using the RealPaver DSL:
    - Continuous (interval domain) or discrete variables (integer domain or ennuerated set of values)
    - Arithmetic constraints (==,<=,>==)
    - Set contraints (in)
    - Table constraints
    - Conditional constraints (->)
* Solving algorithms:
    - Branch-and-Prune algorithm (CSPSolver)
    - Interval contractors/propagators (ACID, BC4, HC4, Interval Newton)
    - Search strategies: branching (DFS, IDFS, DMDFS, PDFS, GPDFS), splitting (RR, LF, SSR, SLF)
    - Preprocessing:  basic simplification
    - Postprocessing: prover (interval Newton), box clustering
    - Linear solver interface (supported solvers: Clp, Soplex, Highs)
    - Local solver interface (supported libraries: Nlopt)
* Documentation:
    - Based on mkdocs
    - Basic user-documentation
* Tests:
    - A few tests implemented
* Benchmark problems and C++ examples relating to the documentation
