# About

## History

The development of RealPaver has been initiated in the late nineties by Laurent Granvilliers during his PhD thesis. Version 0.4, written in C, has been released and described in the following article:

- L. Granvilliers and F. Benhamou. Algorithm 852: Realpaver: an Interval Solver using Constraint Satisfaction Techniques. ACM TOMS, 32(1):138-156, 2006.

More recently in the early twenties, Laurent Granvilliers produced a C++ implementation of RealPaver with new features and algorithms. RaphaÃ«l Chenouard joined the project and brought his experience about modern software development techniques and constraint-based preliminary design of systems. From their collaboration resulted Version 1.0.

Other contributors are: Aida Amerkhanova, Jean Bigeon.
