# About

RealPaver is a long-term project at Nantes, France.


## History

The algorithms implemented in RealPaver emerged in the nineties at the confluence of two fields of research, namely Constraint Programming (CP) and Interval Analysis (IA). IA provides reliable interval arithmetic and tools. CP deals with efficient search techniques. The combination IA+CP provides deterministic search algorithms for solving nonlinear constraint satisfaction and optimization problems that are complete (no solution is lost) and reliable (rounding errors are bounded).

The development of RealPaver has been initiated in the late nineties by Laurent Granvilliers during his PhD thesis. In this early period, the software, written in C, includes a home-made interval arithmetic library and state-of-the-art IA+CP techniques.

More recently in the early twenties, Laurent Granvilliers produced a C++ implementation of RealPaver with new features and algorithms. RaphaÃ«l Chenouard joined the project and brought his experience about modern software development techniques and constraint-based preliminary design of systems.
