The RealPaver library provides a C++ API to deal with constraint satisfaction problems and bound-constrained optimization problems. Various constraints programming algorithms and (local) optimization algorithms are implemented.

The API description is automatically generated using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) and [MkDoxy](https://github.com/JakubAndrysek/MkDoxy).
