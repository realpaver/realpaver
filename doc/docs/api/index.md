The RealPaver library provides a C++ API to deal with constraint satisfaction problems involving discrete and continuous variables. Various algorithms based on interval methods and constraint programming techniques are implemented.

The API description is automatically generated using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) and [MkDoxy](https://github.com/JakubAndrysek/MkDoxy).
